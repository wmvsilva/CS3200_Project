[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
This is every heavy drug, that's known at every level
This assault with deadly metal bumpin' heavy metal
Do this for myself, of course my hood and every ghetto
Paper pushin', paper petal, cause I heavy petal
It's real nigga flowin' through my blood and every vessel
Time is money, so I saved the load on every bezel
I just had a dream, I dipped my watch canary yellow
I woke up and then I bought that bitch in every yellow
Let go back to business, my fizz product for my narrow
Cause life's a bitch with red lipstick and high stilettos
Flaco jumpin' fences from pigs, with 'em them biscuits
I hypnotized my six, but my thirty eight was kinda special
What a life this is, what a sight this is
Where the darks and the light skin kids
Get along with the white percents
All alike when the lights get dim
On a righteous pass, where you don't look back
Nigga spark your cig, niggas light your hash
Niggas light your spliff, where you puff, don't pass, just sit

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I just had an epic dream like Dr. King
Police brutality was on my TV screen
Harmony, love, drugs and peace is all we need
Harmony, love, drugs and peace is all we need
